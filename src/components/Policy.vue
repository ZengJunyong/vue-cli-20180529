          <p>


            We do not allow persons under 18 to register for any service (including the Paktor App), and we do not
            knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from persons under the age of 18. However, we
            are not able to ascertain on our end whether persons who register for our services are actually above 18
            or under. It is thus the responsibility of parents and legal guardians to ensure that their minors do
            not register for or access Paktor or to provide us with Personal Data without parental/legal guardian’s
            consent. If we become aware that a person under 18 has provided us with Personal Data without parental
            or legal guardian’s consent, we will delete such information from our records and terminate any account
            registered with us.

              Do-Not-Call Registries in relation to telephone calls, text or fax messages, we will not send you any
              communications via the channels that you have opted out of by registering with the Do-Not-Call
              Registries. However, if you have previously consented to our sending you communications via your
              telephone number (calls or text messages) and/or facsimile number, we will continue doing so until you
              withdraw your consent by contacting our Data Protection Officer at <a class="email" href="mailto:DPO@gopaktor.com">DPO@gopaktor.com.</a></li>
